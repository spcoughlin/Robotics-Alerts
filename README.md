# Robotics-Alerts

This project was built for my FRC robotics team, team 3958

Our team communicates via email, but we have some trouble checking our email for updates from our moderator, so this bot will ping our discord server whenever the moderator sends an email.

Commands:

.help - help panel
.website - links the team website
enter key - configure the channel the bot will send updates in
